    <h1>DriveVault Terms of Service</h1>
    <p class="meta">Last updated: August 27, 2025</p>

    <h2>Important Notice</h2>
    <p>By downloading, installing, or using DriveVault, you acknowledge that you have read, understood, and agree to be bound by these Terms of Service. If you do not agree to these Terms, do not use the application.</p>

    <h2>1. Acceptance of Terms</h2>
    <p>These Terms of Service (“Terms”) govern your use of DriveVault (“the Application,” “the Software,” “the App”) provided by the DriveVault development team (“we,” “us,” “our”). By accessing or using DriveVault, you agree to comply with and be bound by these Terms.</p>

<h2>2. Description of Service</h2>
<p>DriveVault is a drive scanning and cataloging application for macOS that:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Creates offline catalogs of external drives and storage devices through read-only scanning.</li>
  <li>Optionally creates folder structures at user-selected locations with explicit permission.</li>
  <li>Generates file previews and metadata for organizational purposes.</li>
  <li>Allows export and import of drive catalogs for sharing and backup.</li>
  <li>Provides file organization and search capabilities.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Important Clarification – Not a Backup Service</h2>
<p>DriveVault is <strong>not</strong> a backup application. It does not create copies of your files, and the catalogs shown in the app are for offline reference and search only. They are not substitutes for your actual files.</p>
<p>You must not delete or rely on DriveVault catalogs as your only storage. Users are solely responsible for ensuring their files are properly backed up elsewhere before making any deletions. Deleting files from your physical drives cannot be undone by DriveVault, as the app does not hold copies of your data and has no ability to restore deleted files.</p>
<p>By using the app, you acknowledge and agree that we are not liable for any loss of files caused by user deletion, drive failure, or reliance on DriveVault catalogs as backups.</p>


    
    <h2>3. Description of Service</h2>
    <p>DriveVault is a drive scanning and cataloging application for macOS that:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Creates offline catalogs of external drives and storage devices through read-only scanning.</li>
      <li>Optionally creates folder structures at user-selected locations with explicit permission.</li>
      <li>Generates file previews and metadata for organizational purposes.</li>
      <li>Allows export and import of drive catalogs for sharing and backup.</li>
      <li>Provides file organization and search capabilities.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Critical Liability Disclaimer</h2>
    <p><strong>Read-only scanning:</strong> DriveVault’s core drive-scanning functionality operates exclusively in read-only mode and does not write to, modify, delete, or alter existing files or data on your drives during scanning operations. The application uses macOS sandboxing and security frameworks to support safe operation.</p>
    <p><strong>Controlled write operations:</strong> The optional Folder Templates feature may create new folders and directory structures, but only at locations you explicitly select and authorize. This feature (i) requires explicit user permission and location selection; (ii) never modifies or overwrites existing files; (iii) only creates new, empty folder structures; and (iv) uses secure, sandboxed file operations.</p>
    <p><strong>No liability for hardware issues:</strong> We disclaim liability for hardware failures, drive corruption, data loss, or any other technical issues that may occur coincidentally while using DriveVault. Any such issues are not caused by DriveVault’s read-only scanning operations.</p>
    <p><strong>Technical safeguards include:</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li>macOS App Sandbox restrictions.</li>
      <li>Read-only access for all scanning operations.</li>
      <li>User-authorized write operations only for optional folder creation.</li>
      <li>Error handling and recovery protections.</li>
      <li>Security-scoped resource management.</li>
      <li>No ability to modify or delete existing user data during scanning.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>4. User Responsibilities</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Maintain regular backups of important data.</li>
      <li>Ensure your drives are in good working condition before scanning.</li>
      <li>Use the application in accordance with these Terms.</li>
      <li>Protect your own data and privacy.</li>
      <li>Comply with all applicable laws and regulations.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>5. Prohibited Uses</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Reverse engineering, decompiling, or disassembling the application.</li>
      <li>Using the application for illegal purposes.</li>
      <li>Redistributing or selling the application without permission.</li>
      <li>Circumventing security measures.</li>
      <li>Using the application to violate others’ privacy rights.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>6. Privacy and Data Collection</h2>
    <p>DriveVault is designed with privacy as a core principle:</p>

      <li>No analytics, tracking, or telemetry data is collected by the application.</li>
      <li>You have complete control over exported data.</li>

    <h2>9. Indemnification</h2>
    <p>You agree to indemnify and hold harmless the DriveVault development team from any claims, damages, losses, or expenses arising from your use of the application or violation of these Terms.</p>

    <h2>10. Software Updates</h2>
    <p>We may provide updates to improve functionality and security. Updates may modify features or system requirements. Continued use after updates constitutes acceptance of the updated Terms where applicable.</p>

    <h2>11. Termination</h2>
    <p>These Terms remain in effect until terminated. You may terminate by discontinuing use and deleting the application. We may suspend or terminate access for violations of these Terms.</p>

    <h2>12. Governing Law</h2>
    <p>These Terms are governed by the laws of our primary place of business, without regard to conflict-of-law principles. Any disputes shall be resolved in the courts with jurisdiction over that location.</p>

      <li>Refunds for purchases are handled directly by Apple in accordance with their refund policy. We do not process refunds ourselves.</li>
      <li>Some features of the app may require an active subscription to access. If your subscription lapses, those features will no longer be available until the subscription is renewed.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>14. Severability</h2>
    <p>If any provision of these Terms is found unenforceable, the remaining provisions shall remain in full force and effect.</p>

    <h2>15. Changes to Terms</h2>
    <p>We may modify these Terms at any time. Changes are effective upon posting to this page. Your continued use constitutes acceptance of the modified Terms.</p>

    <h2>16. Force Majeure</h2>
